# Projects

I have a number of side-projects that are a decent representation of my style of code.

## OAuth Tester

![GCPF Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GCP_Functions-6794db?style=flat&labelColor=4285F4&logo=google-cloud&logoColor=white)

OAuth Tester is an app made to help developers to test their OAuth2 clients. It's made using GCP Cloud Functions and Firebase hosting. Create credentials and then test your client against it to help the debug process.

You can check it out at [https://testoauth.com](https://testoauth.com) or view the [source on Github](https://github.com/truggeri/oauth-debugger).

## Go Sudoku

![Go Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Go-0084c0?style=flat&labelColor=00ADD8&logo=go&logoColor=white)

When I'm learning a new language, a sudoku solver is my go-to application. This implementation uses Go and has a test and benchmark.

You can [view the source on Github](https://github.com/truggeri/go-sudoku).

## Ruby Sudoku

![Ruby Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ruby-81302f?style=flat&labelColor=9a1c19&logo=ruby&logoColor=white)

Similar to the Go implementation, the Ruby sudoku solver was made to help me experiment with Ruby when I was learning. It now includes an RSpec test suite.
